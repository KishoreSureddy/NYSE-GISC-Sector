The Excel project work on the NYSE GICS Sector dataset involves applying data exploration, modeling, and statistical analysis techniques to compare the costs incurred by companies in the Industrial and IT sectors. The project aims to identify which sector incurs more costs, using data from the financial statements of the companies listed in these sectors.

The project involves importing the dataset into Excel and performing data exploration and cleaning techniques to ensure the data is accurate and reliable. The project then involves developing financial models and conducting statistical analysis to compare the costs incurred by companies in the Industrial and IT sectors.

The financial models may include developing different metrics such as gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net profit margin. The project may also involve developing a model that compares the financial performance of the companies in the two sectors, using various financial ratios.

The statistical analysis may involve conducting hypothesis tests and regression analysis to determine the relationship between the costs incurred and the sector in which the company operates.

The project's conclusion can provide valuable insights into the performance of the Industrial and IT sectors, which can be used to inform investment decisions. The results can also help managers in the two sectors to identify areas where they can reduce costs and improve their financial performance.
